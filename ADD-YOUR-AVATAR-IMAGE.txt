📸 IMPORTANT: ADD YOUR NESAKIRA AVATAR IMAGE
==========================================

This file is a reminder that you need to add your character's profile image!

🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
----------------------

1. Find or create an image of your NesaKira character
   - Anime style works best
   - Square format recommended (500x500px or larger)
   - Should be clear and high quality

2. Rename your image file to:
   nesakira-avatar.jpg
   
   ⚠️ Important:
   - Must be exactly this name
   - All lowercase letters
   - .jpg extension (not .png, .jpeg, or anything else)

3. Place it in the SAME FOLDER as:
   - index.html
   - style.css
   - script.js

4. When uploading to GitHub:
   - Upload this image along with the other 3 files
   - Make sure it's in the root folder (not in a subfolder)

🎨 IMAGE SPECIFICATIONS:
-----------------------

Format: JPG/JPEG
Recommended Size: 500x500 pixels (or larger, square format)
File Size: Keep under 500KB for best performance
Style: Anime/illustrated character
Background: Any (will be cropped to circle)

✨ WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T ADD IT:
------------------------------------

Don't worry! The website will still work perfectly.

If the image is missing, users will see:
- A beautiful gradient circle (pink/purple colors)
- A sparkle emoji (✨) in the center
- Still looks great, just without your custom character

You can always add your image later by:
1. Going to your GitHub repository
2. Clicking "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Uploading nesakira-avatar.jpg
4. Committing the change

The website will automatically show your image once uploaded!

🖼️ WHERE IS THIS IMAGE USED:
-----------------------------

Your avatar appears in multiple places:
- Main character card (large, center of page)
- Chat messages (small avatar next to bot replies)
- These images are automatically synchronized
